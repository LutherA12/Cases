          This is the “elephant in the room” regarding your questions, comments
          & position on this issue. We are after all talking about the Rapture
          (pre-trib in this case, I.E. the church being exempt from the
          tribulation thus leading to the Rapture & the second coming being two
          different events, Rapture at the beginning of the 7 years & second
          coming at the end of the 7 years) so this seems like the perfect place
          to start as it hits everything we want to discuss. <br />
          <br />
          <h4>
            {" "}
            1. The Tribulation period is (among other things) for Israel, thus
            the Church isn’t necessary (i.e. our job is done)
          </h4>
          <br />
          <br /> This is the most important reason for the tribulation period.
          God keeps his promises & there are many promises God has made to
          Israel both conditionally & unconditionally. <br />
          <br /> In this case we want to look at the unconditional promise God
          made to Abraham, also known as the Abrahamic covenant. This is found
          in Genesis 12:1-3 <br />
          <br />
          <i>
            {" "}
            “The LORD had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people &
            your father’s household to the land I will show you. 2 “I will make
            you into a great nation, & I will bless you; 3 I will bless those
            who bless you, & whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on
            earth will be blessed through you.”
          </i>
          <br />
          <br />
          This promise has been partially met but has not come to complete
          fulfillment yet. It’s self-evident to anyone watching the evening news
          why this promise hasn’t been completed yet, but we also know this
          because of passages such as Ezekiel 36:1-37 & Ezekiel 20:33-37, 40-42;
          Romans 11:25-27; & Zechariah 12:10-14. <br />
          <br /> <h3 className="headers">Ezekiel</h3> <br /> You’ve probably
          heard that on May 14, 1948 the “State of Israel” was born, however,
          this state is only a very small portion of what God originally
          promised Abraham. As such, after the tribulation period, Israel will
          be granted the full weight of what they have been promised by God,
          again, God keeps His promises. Now you may be asking, “will God force
          Israel into the land He promised them?” No, He won’t & that’s the
          beauty of the tribulation period, it will be a time of testing for
          Israel & those that finally accept Jesus Christ as Messiah will
          inherit the land promised to them long ago. Most Jewish people
          nowadays don’t accept Jesus Christ as Messiah&this makes sense since
          they rejected Jesus in Matthew 27:22 “22 Pilate said to them, “Then
          what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let
          him be crucified!” Jesus in the eyes of the Jews failed to do what
          they expected of their Messiah; I.E. destroy their enemies, eradicate
          evil, & establish an eternal kingdom with Israel as the primary nation
          in the world. There are plenty of passages that describe what Jesus
          would need to do first (suffer & die) including Isaiah 53 & Psalms 22,
          however, the Jews chose not to focus on those prophecies & instead
          focused on Jesus’s glorious victories after His death. <br />
          <br />
          <h3 className="headers">Romans</h3> <br /> Romans 11:25-27 has to do
          with all of Israel being saved, or in other words, accepting Jesus
          Christ as their savior. We just talked about how most Jews today don’t
          accept Him as savior & the Jewish people as a whole already rejected
          Him long ago in Matthew, so this promise hasn’t been fulfilled yet
          either. It is a future event that will happen during the tribulation
          period. We know this based on Zechariah 13:8, 9 “8 In the whole land,”
          declares the LORD, “two-thirds will be struck down & perish; yet
          one-third will be left in it. 9 This third I will put into the fire; I
          will refine them like silver & test them like gold. They will call on
          my name & I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are my people,’ & they
          will say, ‘The LORD is our God.’” The word “fire” in scripture is
          usually used as a word for trial, test or in this context
          “tribulation”. God will “test” His chosen people Israel during the
          tribulation period & “refine” them. They are His chosen people after
          all. <br />
          <br /> <h3 className="headers">Zechariah</h3> <br /> Zechariah
          12:10-14 has to do with Israel as a whole repenting & receiving
          forgiveness. This passage speaks of Israel mourning for “the One they
          Pierced” I.E. Jesus Christ. This most certainly hasn’t happened yet,
          but again, this will happen during the Tribulation period. <br />
          <br />
          <h4>
            2. The Tribulation period is for an outpouring of God’s wrath not
            only on sinful man, but on the unholy trinity (the anti-Christ, the
            devil, the false prophet)
          </h4>{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          This may seem trivial & obvious but there are some important points to
          be drawn here. <br />
          <br />
          John 16:33{" "}
          <i>
            “33 “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
            In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome
            the world.”
          </i>
          <br />
          <br /> Jesus tells His disciples & us very plainly, we will have
          hardships or “tribulation” down here on Earth. However, there is a
          very big difference between facing the wrath of men vs. facing the
          wrath of God. We face the wrath of wicked men every day this world is
          proof of that, but the tribulation period will be totally different,
          if you’ve ever read about the Trumpet, Scroll & Bowl Judgements in
          Revelation, you know what I’m talking about. The tribulation period is
          primarily God’s wrath against unrepentant man & demons, not man’s
          wrath against other men. <br />
          <br />
          Furthermore, it says in 1 Thessalonians 5:9{" "}
          <i>
            “9 For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive
            salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
          </i>
          <br />
          <br /> Well, whose wrath is God talking about us not being appointed
          to suffer? It can’t be man’s wrath because God already told us we
          would suffer that, it can’t be demonic wrath because that was never
          part of this context, so who’s wrath is left for us to NOT suffer? The
          wrath of the lamb is all that's left (Revelation 6:16); the church
          simply isn’t necessary on Earth anymore during the Tribulation (I.E.
          the time of God’s wrath or Jacobs trouble; Jacob in this context
          meaning Israel), the churches job will be finished. The responsibility
          of spreading the gospel will fall to the 144,000 chosen & the two
          witnesses (these will all be Jewish people by the way which fits the
          context of the tribulation since God is turning his eyes back to
          Israel to finish what He started). <br />
          <br />
          When the anti-Christ rises to power he will try & make a peace treaty
          with none other than Israel & Israel will accept it for a time until
          they figure out that the treaty is false (during the abomination of
          desolation). Satan hates God, but he cannot kill God, so, killing &
          harming God’s people is the next best thing. The Middle East & the
          Jewish people will be the full focus of the tribulation, not the
          church & certainly not America. <br />
          <br />
          <h4>
            3. The Tribulation period can be used to show that God can preach
            the gospel without the church{" "}
          </h4>{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          Please don’t misunderstand me, I am not saying “don’t preach Jesus
          Christ” or “don’t give other’s the good news”. Not at all! Matthew
          28:16-20 is known as the Great Commission & Jesus is very clear about
          telling his disciples to go & make disciples of all nations, not just
          Jews but Gentiles alike. We are to follow that command & tell as many
          people as we can about the good news of Jesus Christ! <br />
          <br /> My point is that while God allows us to take part in telling
          the good news to as many people as we can & of course God rewards us
          for being obedient, He (that is God) does not need us to take part in
          telling the good news & is perfectly capable of doing the job Himself.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          It’s very similar to how I can allow my son to cut the grass & shovel
          snow in order for me to reward him with allowance money & teach him
          responsibility, however, I don’t need him to shovel snow or cut grass,
          I’m very capable of doing it myself. <br />
          <br /> Revelation 13:6, 7{" "}
          <i>
            “6 Then I saw another angel flying in midair, & he had the eternal
            gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation,
            tribe, language & people. 7 He said in a loud voice, “Fear God &
            give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship
            him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea & the springs of
            water.”
          </i>
          <br />
          <br /> So, as you can see, angels can proclaim the gospel just as
          humans can. It’s really up to God how He wants to have the gospel
          proclaimed. God Himself could simply give the gospel to everyone, all
          over the world, all at once & be done with it without any human
          intervention at all, however, that misses the point of being a
          Christian I.E. people working with & loving other people.

          I believe that first paradigm gives us a good framework to move

          <br />
          <b>
            “If that stuff isn't going to happen until the man of sin is
            revealed, how is that consistent with the pretrib rapture theory? If
            the man of sin is destroyed at the rapture, how does that fit with
            pretrib?”
          </b>{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          The man of sin is ONLY revealed once the church is “out of the way”.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />2 Thess 2:7, 8{" "}
          <i>
            “7 For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the
            one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken
            out of the way. 8 & then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the
            Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth & destroy by
            the splendor of his coming.”
          </i>{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          If you’ve read scripture for any length of time you already should
          know that one passage of scripture does not contradict or diminish
          another, instead, you must look at scripture in light of other
          scriptures. Scripture deepens scripture. It may sound like circular
          reasoning, however, God is the source of all reason so if anyone is
          correct, it’s Him. <br />
          <br />
          The “secret power is lawlessness” is speaking about the “lawless one”,
          or the “man of sin”, “the beast”, “the anti-christ”, that much is
          obvious from the context, what might not be so obvious is who “the one
          who now holds it back” is. <br />
          <br />
          Once we accept Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit comes to live inside of
          us (1 cor 3:16, 6:19) so, it logically follows that when the Church
          gets Raptured, the Holy Spirit goes too & in this case, “He” (that is
          the Holy Spirit) is the one who now holds back the appearance of the
          anti-christ until “He” (again, Holy Spirit) gets “taken” out of the
          way or Raptured in this context along with the Church before the
          tribulation starts. <br />
          <br /> THEN, the man of lawlessness or the “lawless one” will be
          revealed, the tribulation will happen, THEN the second coming where
          Jesus “overthrows” (destroys) the anti-christ with the breath of His
          coming. The road map is blatantly clear in context. <br />
          <br /> Finally, anytime scripture mentions the Rapture (see passages
          that we’ve been talking about), it’s always mentioned as a secret
          thing, it’s will be a quiet surprise; all of a sudden “in the
          twinkling of an eye” we will be translated whereas the second coming
          “every eye will see Him”. <br />
          <br /> There is also the matter of knowing the time of His return,
          Matthew 24:36{" "}
          <i>
            “36 “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in
            heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. ”
          </i>{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          In context, the disciples are asking Jesus about eschatology & He
          explains to them in verses 29-31 that AFTER the tribulation He will
          appear & send angels to gather His elect (not to be confused with the
          church since He personally already gathered us 7 years prior, but in
          context here He sends His angels to gather the 144,000 Jewish
          believers & anyone else that has accepted Him during the tribulation
          period). The Rapture only counts for Christians who are part of the
          church right now in the church age. Furthermore, if Christians went
          through ANY part of the tribulation, you can best believe we would
          know EXACTLY when Jesus would show up. We could time it down to the
          minute because as soon as the anti-Christ is revealed, the clock
          starts & anyone who has accepted Jesus would know “He is either coming
          to get me in 3 ½ years or in 7 years from “this time”, whatever that
          time is.
