            those that do not have the means (time, energy, resources, etc.) to
            properly celebrate the "new" passover to the exact standards?
            Why not just make it uniform & save everyone with the same standard?

      Matthew 7:13 tells us â€œEnter through the narrow gate.
      For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
      But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it." Also, 2 Peter 3:9 says
      "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness.
      Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."
      Yet, this supposed biblical understanding about the new passover being necessary for salvation is simply not mentioned in many passages &
      is outright contradicted in others. What kind of God is that? How can you know which scriptures are true & which are not?`,

        For now though let me say that no passage of scripture contradicts any other passage, instead, they deepen & embelish one another.`,
